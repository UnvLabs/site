# Why Unv?

We can't use one langauge for everything. Unv is a attempt to make a simple one for this purpose.With simple syntax similar to python , it can be used for any task.

**It can be compiled to:**

- JS
- Python
- _More to come_

**It can be used for:**

- Web
- IOT
- pretty much anything else

**Here's a taste of UNV :**

```py
import 'print' from 'stdio'

if 'Unv is awesome!'
    print('Hello World!')
```

:::info
Currently UNV is under development
