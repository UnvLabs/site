# Data Types

## Basic Data Types

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Unv has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

- Text Type:
    - `string`
- Numeric Types:
    - `int`,  `float`(= `number`),  `complex`
- Sequence Types:
    - `array`
- Mapping Type:
    - `map` 
- Boolean Type:
    - `boolean`

<!--
## Getting the Data Type

You can get the data type of any object by using the  `type()`  function:

Print the data type of the variable x:
```py
x =  5  
print(type(x))
```

import Support from "@theme/Support";

<Support py />

-->

## Setting the Data Type

In Unv, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

Example|Data Type
-|-
`x = "Hello World"`|string
`x = 20`|int
`x = 20.5`|float
`x = 1j`|complex
`x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`|array
`x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}`|map
`x = true`|boolean

<!--
## Setting the Specific Data Type
-->

import Support from "@theme/Support";

<Support py js/>
**Complex numbers are not supported in JavaScript.**
