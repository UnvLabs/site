# String Concatenation

## String Concatenation

To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

Merge variable  `a`  with variable  `b`  into variable  `c`:

```py
a =  "Hello"  
b =  "World"  
c = a + b  
print(c)
```

To add a space between them, add a  `" "`:

```py
a =  "Hello"  
b =  "World"  
c = a +  " "  + b  
print(c)
```
