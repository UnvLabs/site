#  Getting Started

## Quickstart

Unv has an online playground, this means that as a developer you write Unv in a online editor and then execute them.

Open your web browser, navigate to the [playground](/playground). Delete all the existing code and start coding with following snippet.

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

The output should read:

```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Unv program.
