# Assign Multiple Values

## Many Values to Multiple Variables

Unv allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:

```py {1}
x, y, z =  "Orange",  "Banana",  "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

**Note:** Make sure the number of variables is equal or lower than the number of values.

## One Value to Multiple Variables

And you can assign the _same_ value to multiple variables in one line:

```py {1}
x = y = z =  "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```

## Unpack a Collection

If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Unv allows you extract the values into variables. This is called _unpacking_.

Unpack a list:

```py {2}
fruits = ["apple",  "banana",  "cherry"]
x, y, z = ...fruits
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
